The Slayer is our 140mm 29” big-wheeled trail bike featuring a steeper 77° seat angle and the best attributes from both its Following and Wreckoning brothers. Still, the Slayer stands on its own, with an increased reach that benefits both climbing and descending, a fierce DH capability, an Enduro heart, and diabolical cornering powers. Quiet, stiff, fast and poppy-as-hell, the Offering sacrifices nothing but gives you God-like powers. All hail, the Dark Lord of singletrack.",

Just pour some of this milky goo into your tubeless-compatible tires, pop them onto the bead, and spin 'em around to get an even coating that will protect you from leaks and punctures all the way up to 1/4in. It makes it safer and easier to run tubeless tires at low pressure, and can work with wheels designed to be run tubeless or wheels that have been converted to accommodate a tubeless setup. Sharp rocks, thorns, and broken glass won't ruin your ride anymore, and the ability to ride at lower pressures will increase grip when you're in slick terrain.",
