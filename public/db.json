Still, the Slayer stands on its own, with an increased reach that benefits both climbing and descending, a fierce DH capability, an Enduro heart, and diabolical cornering powers. Quiet, stiff, fast and poppy-as-hell, the Offering sacrifices nothing but gives you God-like powers. All hail, the Dark Lord of singletrack.",

It makes it safer and easier to run tubeless tires at low pressure, and can work with wheels designed to be run tubeless or wheels that have been converted to accommodate a tubeless setup. Sharp rocks, thorns, and broken glass won't ruin your ride anymore, and the ability to ride at lower pressures will increase grip when you're in slick terrain.",
